## The learner's toolkit: what to prioritize at each stage

Rather than simply listing tools, this section synthesizes what combination of resources works best at each stage.

**For N5 beginners**, the Japan Foundation's free ecosystem is unmatched: **IRODORI** (free 1,433-page textbook with audio) and **Marugoto** on the **Minato** platform provide complete structured courses at zero cost. Supplement with **Tadoku** and **YomuJP** for graded reading, **Comprehensible Japanese** on YouTube for listening, **Anki** with a Core 2k deck for vocabulary, and **OJAD** for pitch accent awareness from day one. **Obenkyo** (Android) is the best completely free all-in-one JLPT app.

**At N4–N3**, the transition from textbook to authentic material is the biggest challenge. **NHK NEWS WEB EASY** becomes a daily reading staple. **Satori Reader** bridges the gap with annotated native content. **Nihongo con Teppei** (podcast) and **Japanese with Noriko** provide graded listening input. **Yomitan** (browser extension) transforms all web reading into study material. **Bunpro** systematizes grammar review. For writing practice, **LangCorrect** replaces the now-defunct Lang-8.

**At N2–N1**, learners should shift to native content with support tools. **Language Reactor** on Netflix/YouTube, **jpdb.io** for pre-learning media vocabulary, **Bilingual News** and **NHK World Radio** for listening, and **Aozora Bunko Portal** for literature. For pitch accent refinement, **Dogen's** free introductory videos plus **OJAD** are essential. **IMABI** provides the grammar depth needed for N1. Writing correction from **Hinoki Project's Natsume** checks collocations against native corpora.

**Across all levels**, three tools stand out as universally essential: **Jisho.org** (dictionary), **Anki** (SRS flashcards), and **Yomitan** (browser popup dictionary). These three together form the backbone of any self-study routine.

## Conclusion

The Japanese language learning ecosystem in 2025–2026 is remarkably rich. The **Japan Foundation's free platforms** (IRODORI, Marugoto, Minato, Erin's Challenge) provide institutional-quality structured courses at zero cost — a resource that few other languages enjoy. **NHK NEWS WEB EASY** remains the single best daily reading resource for N4–N3 learners. The closure of **Lang-8** in February 2024 created a gap now filled by **LangCorrect**, **HiNative**, and AI tools like **Fix My Japanese**. AI-powered tools (ChatGPT, TalkPal) have emerged as flexible conversation partners, though they work best as supplements to human interaction through platforms like **Tandem**, **HelloTalk**, and **Hilokal**. The biggest shift in the space is the rise of **immersion-support tools** — Yomitan, Language Reactor, jpdb.io — which make consuming native content accessible far earlier than traditional approaches allowed. For self-directed learners, the combination of these free tools can rival or exceed paid programs, provided they commit to consistent daily engagement across all four skills.
